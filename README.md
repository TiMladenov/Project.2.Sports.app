# Project 2: Score keeper application
v2.2 of Udacity Project 2 - Sport score keeper App

# Description
This project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything that I have learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. I made an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal was to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of my choice. I chose to create an application for tennis game scorekeeping. The app has 3x Activities: Loading screen, Activity to enter the names of the two players and the scoring logic and UI activity itself.

# Requirements
The design must include:
- Layout:
  - App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
  - Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team. Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added.
  - Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either a different kind of scoring OR track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for instance).
  - The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
  - Text sizes are defined in sp, lengths are defined in dp, padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
- Functionality:
  - The code runs without errors.
  - Each score button updates the score TextView in its column by adding the correct number of points.
  - The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.
- Code Readability:
  - Any classes are named after the object they represent.All variables are named by their intended contents. All methods are named by their intended effect or in the style required by a callback interface.
  - The code within a method is indented with respect to the method declaration line.
